		Design $2^{nd}$ order filter by cascading two first order filters together, followed by a gain stage.\\
		\\
		Design the filter by starting with prototype stages then frequency and magnitude scaling to get desired properties. \\
		\\
		Now a prototype first order active high pass filter has unity gain in the passband and a cutoff frequency of $\omega_c = 1$ rad/s, and is of form:
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\begin{circuitikz}
				\draw (0,3) to[R=$R_s$] (2,3)
					to[C=$C_s$] (4,3) 
					to[short] (4,5) 
					to[R=$R_f$] (7,5)
					to[short] (7,2.5);
				\draw (0,3) to[open, v_=$v_i$, o-o] (0,0);
				\draw (0,0) to[short, o-o] (8,0);
				\draw (5.5,2.5) node[op amp] (opamp) {}
					(opamp.-) to[short, -*] (4,3) 
					(opamp.+) to[short] (4,2) to[short,-*] (4,0)
					(opamp.out) to[short, -*] (7,2.5) to[short, -o] (8,2.5);
				\draw(8,0) to [open, v<=$v_o$, o-o] (8,2.5);
			\end{circuitikz}
		\end{figure}
		Noting that a circuit of this form has transfer function:
		\begin{equation*}
			H_L(s) = \frac{-s}{s+1}
		\end{equation*}
		Now when two of these are connected in cascade, the overall transfer function is:
		\begin{align*}
			H(s) &= H_L(s) \cdot H_L(s) \\
			&= \frac{s^2}{(s+1)^2}
		\end{align*}
