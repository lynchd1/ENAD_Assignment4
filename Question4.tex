%Question 4

Design this filter by connecting a Butterworth low pass filter with a Butterworth highpass filter in parallel, then connecting both with a summing amplifier.\\
\\
Start with designing the low pass section.\\
The 3$^\text{rd}$ order normalised Butterworth polynomial is:
\begin{equation*}
	\big(s+1 \big) \big(s^2+s+1 \big)
\end{equation*}
Therefore the 3$^\text{rd}$ order normalised Butterworth low pass filter has the following transfer function:
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1}{\big(s+1 \big) \big(s^2+s+1 \big)} = \frac{1}{\, s+1 \,} \cdot \frac{1}{\, s^2+s+1 \,}
\end{equation*}
This results in a cascade of a 1$^\text{st}$ order low pass filter with a 2$^\text{nd}$ order low pass filter, both with passband gains of 1 V/V and cutoff frequencies of 1 rad/s. This can be achieved with the following circuit:
